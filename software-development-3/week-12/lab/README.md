# Additional F# exercise

#### My sister in law has a great formula for cakes. 

 

The rule is: 

  * You can take any number of eggs 
  * You weigh the eggs with their shells on 
  * You then measure the same weight of butter, sugar and flour. 
  * You add the same number of teaspoons of baking powder as the number of eggs 

(use the average weight of an egg of 80grams, or yo ucan calculate this but also taking the total weight of the eggs as a parameter) 

  * Optionally you can add some cocoa or fruit.  If you add cocoa you need one tablespoon of cocoa and 50ml of milk for each egg.
  * Method is to mix the sugar and butter, add the eggs and then the rest of the ingredients and bake in a lined tin.

 

Use F# to output a cake recipe for a given number of eggs and their total weight 

See how many different ways you can write it (eg. Ussing pipelines, lambdas, types/classes)
