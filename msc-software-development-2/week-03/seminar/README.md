# Software Development 2 Seminar 03 -- Team Session

Use your seminar time to work with your team and prepare for the Sprint 1 hand-in (which will be reviewed next week).

The brief for Sprint 1 is:

The aim of this Sprint is to check that the project workflow is set up for the team, that you are ready to work together and have an outline of your project objectives.

Submission requirements for this Sprint:

- A short  overview of your application idea your team want to design and develop (one or two precise sentances)
- A problem statement that expresses the purpose of the application
- One or more 'persona' that expresses how and why people might use your application
- The technical foundations for teamwork established ie:
  - [ ] GitHub project for coursework created, lecturer added as a collaborator and link supplied
  - [ ] Task board created, lecturer added as a collaborator and link supplied
  - [ ] Code of Conduct defined.
        
Links to your github repo and taskboard should be in your documentation submitted.


__Remember...__

- __'Less is more' !!  If you can describe your project succinctly, you will better be able to build it!__
- __Make sure to focus on the problem at this stage rather than the solution__



## Activity

Firstly, in your groups decide who is facilitating the  meeting today.

#### 1. Problem statement

A problem statement answers the following questions - the 5w's:

 - What is the problem?
 - Who is affected by the problem?
 - Where does the problem occur?
 - When does the problem occur?
 - Why does the problem occur and why is it important to solve?

Remember that...

 - A problem statement should identify and explain a problemâ€‹
 - It should not identify a solution, but should suggest many possible solutions

See if you can formulate the problem statement in your group.


__How can we... questions__

Attempt to write three or four 'how can we...' questions should cover the purposes of your project. Questions in this format are often used by designers. _They are useful becuase they focus on the problem that needs solving rather than jump into a solution too early on._

Example:
(for coffee shop review site)
1. How can we help people find good coffee shops in a particular town?
2. How can we enable keen coffee drinkers to rate coffee shops?
3. How can we enable coffee drinkers keep track of coffee shops they have visited before?

#### 2. Personas and Scenarios

Using personas and scenarios is a way that you can explore your user needs.  This exercise will help you reach a *shared understanding* of the purpose of your application, the context in which people will use it, and a high level view of the functions it should have.  

Later you can build on this understanding of user NEEDS to extract the features and requirements, and express these more formally.

During your agile development methodology, you can return to these Personas to help you think about changed requirements.

Build at least two personas / scenarios as per this article:

https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/personas  

(See the example tab)

Once you have done this, you will be better able to formulate a short statement of the purpose.

#### 3. Populuate your task board

Start populating your task board with the upcoming tasks for the next sprint

 * Complete personas
 * Write user stories
 * Create wireframes
 
... etc

#### 4. Refine and test your code of conduct

Look at the group dynamics presentation on Moodle (week 2): https://moodle.roehampton.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=1640620. 
Test your code of conduct against ONE of the scenarios on slide 16.  Can you code of conduct help you solve these problems?
