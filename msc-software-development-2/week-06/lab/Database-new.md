## Understanding asynchronous javascript

Before you embark on using node.js to connect to a database you need to understand the basics of an important feature of javascript - synchronous and asynchronous function calls.

In most procedural code where you can be sure that your code will run in sequence, line by line. This can lead to frustration as tasks that take longer to run will delay other code from executing.

However, Javascript while is traditionally 'single-threaded', ie runs code line by line, also has the ability to run code asynchronously, ie with multiple tasks running at the same time. This makes javascript fast and therefore desirable for a web programming language.

However, you now need to be careful how you write your code.  You need to be aware of which code has a dependency on values set in your program.  For example, there are times when you need the return value of a function in order to proceed with the next step in you program.  One such example of this is a call to a database.  The call can be relatively slow, but we need to tell our application to wait for the database result to continue with certain steps.  Meanwhile however, some other steps are not dependent on the result and may proceed.

Study this article and its links for more information.

[MDN article on Asychronous javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)

### Callbacks and Promises

There are a number of different styles of writing asynchronous code which you may encounter.  We will use the most uptodate style which makes use of 'Promises'.

_"Essentially, a Promise is an object that represents an intermediate state of an operation â€” in effect, a promise that a result of some kind will be returned at some point in the future. There is no guarantee of exactly when the operation will complete and the result will be returned, but there is a guarantee that when the result is available, or the promise fails, the code you provide will be executed in order to do something else with a successful result, or to gracefully handle a failure case."_

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises

Older styles of javascript uses 'callbacks' which can result in confusing, highly nested code.

In newer versions of javascript there are three language constructs which we will use to implement asynchronous code with promises: 

__async__ functions.  If a function or method definition is prefaced with the work __async__ then the progam knows that the function will likely contain code that must return a result before the next line is executed.

__await__ keyword.  This keyword indicates that the value needs to be obtained before the next code is executed.  A 'Promise' is returned in the interim

Try typing the following lines into your browser's JS console:

```js
function hello() { return "Hello" };
hello();
```

But what if we turn this into an async function? Try the following:

```js
async function hello() { return "Hello" };
hello();
```
In the second version, a Promise is returned (in this case it is immediately fulfilled as the code does not take time to execute)

Within an async function, the 'await' keyword will be found: 'await' can ONLY be used within functions with the async keyword, and can be called on any function that returns a promise.

Using _await_ tells your program to only continue once the Promise has been resolved.

__.then()__ 

If you need to make sure that your code calling an async function only executes when the fully 'resolved' value of the promise is returned, you can use a .then() block.

See the following example:

```html

<html>
<script>

async function hello(mystring) {
    var ret = await Promise.resolve('hello');
    return mystring;
}

// The hello function is called, 
// when its return value is ready, ie. the promise is resolved,
// the function in the 'then' block is called
// note that the return value can be used in the .then blocks

hello('lisa').then(mystring => {alert(mystring)});

</script>
</html>
```

Because getting data from a database is one of the more time consuming operations, we will use async functions and promises in our code to ensure that we have the values we need for certain code blocks, while still being able to execute non-dependent blocks of code.

## Your first database driven application

You will have built your environment from the Docker starter recipe which makes a lot of things simple for you!

### Checklist 1:  Getting your environment running

* Can you run ```docker-compose up``` without error
Can you access http://127.0.0.1:3000 without error and see the words 'hello world'?
 * With your containers running, can you alter this block of test code in app/app.js, save, then reload the browser and see your changes? (HINT: watch the console)

```js
app.get("/", function(req, res) {
    res.send("Hello world!");
});
```
 * Can you access phpmyadmin at http://127.0.0.1:8081 and log in using your credentials set in your .env file?
 
### Checklist 2: Check your understanding

  * __Visit the file services/db.js.  Note the following:__ 
 
   1. we require the dotenv package which is able to read configuration from the .env file
   2. We require the mysql2 package (which has some more advanced features that the mysql npm package, specifically the part that works with Promises) see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2
   3. We use the mysql configuration to create a 'pool' of connections
   4. A utility async function query() is supplied that will handle sending a query to the database and returning rows as the result. (This function is a wrapper around the Mysql2 provided execute function which itself provides useful utilities such as prepared statements and releasing a connection back to the pool).
   
```js
// Utility function to query the database
async function query(sql, params) {
  const [rows, fields] = await pool.execute(sql, params);

  return rows;
}
```
   
  * __Visit the app.js file. Note the following__
  
   1. Note that we require the db.js file to set up the database connection
   2. Check that each of the routes already defined work as expected. Make sure you understand every line of code.
   3. Does the route http://127.0.0.1 work?  If not, can you work out why?  ( we will fix it in the next section )
  

### Checklist 3: Saving your code

You should ensure that you have a git repository to save the code you develop today.

1. When you open a terminal and type ```git status``` you should receive a message saying 'not a git repository'. If your directory is still connected to the docker-recipes directory, remove the .git directory.
2. You should now follow the instructions in the page linked below to start a new respository and upload it to github

[Github documentation - a new repository from existing files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line#adding-a-project-to-github-without-github-cli)

3. Regularly commit and push your work during this lab


### Getting started: Creating a database and testing your connection from your node.js app

We won't be able to start writing code that uses the database until we have some data to work with.  


1. Go to PhpMyadmin. Make sure there is a database created called 'test_database'. If there is not, create one, and add this to the .env file which should look something like this...

```
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=admin
MYSQL_PASS=password
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass1234
MYSQL_DATABASE=test_database
MYSQL_ROOT_USER=root
DB_CONTAINER=db
DB_PORT=3306
```

2. In phpmyadmin, create a table called test_table
Populate it with some values by creating some columns (the structure tab)
And adding some values (the insert tab)

2. Now visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/db_test
Do you see the values you inserted?

3. Make sure you understand every line of code in the relevant part of app.js. Here is the code with a few extra annotations.

```js
// Create a route for testing the db
app.get("/db_test", function(req, res) {

    // Prepare an SQL query that will return all rows from the test_table
    var sql = 'select * from test_table';
    
    // Use the db.query() function from services/db.js to send our query
    // We need the result to proceed, but
    // we are not inside an async function we cannot use await keyword here.
    // So we use a .then() block to ensure that we wait until the 
    // promise returned by the async function is resolved before we proceed
    db.query(sql).then(results => {
    
        // Take a peek in the console
        console.log(results);
        
        // Send to the web pate
        res.send(results)
    });
});
```

### Adding some more data to the database

Populate your database by adding the following data via SQL queries. You can do this in bulk straight into phpmyadmin. 

  * Click onto test_database in the left sidebar
  * Click SQL in the tabs along the top
  * Paste the following into the SQL window and click 'go'
  * You will see the tables and data being created

```sql
CREATE TABLE Modules (
code VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO Modules VALUES('CMP020C101','Software Development 1');
INSERT INTO Modules VALUES('CMP020C102','Computer Systems');
INSERT INTO Modules VALUES('CMP020C103','Mathematics for Computer Science');
INSERT INTO Modules VALUES('CMP020C104','Software Development 2');
INSERT INTO Modules VALUES('CMP020C105','Computing and Society');
INSERT INTO Modules VALUES('CMP020C106','Databases');
INSERT INTO Modules VALUES('PHY020C101','Physics Skills and Techniques');

INSERT INTO Programmes VALUES('09UU0001','BSc Computer Science');
INSERT INTO Programmes VALUES('09UU0002','BEng Software Engineering');
INSERT INTO Programmes VALUES('09UU0003','BSc Physics');
CREATE TABLE Programme_Modules(
programme VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
module VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (programme) REFERENCES Programmes(id),
FOREIGN KEY (module) REFERENCES Modules(code));
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0001','CMP020C101');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0001','CMP020C102');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0001','CMP020C103');

INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0001','CMP020C106');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0002','CMP020C101');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0002','CMP020C102');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0002','CMP020C103');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0002','CMP020C104');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0002','CMP020C105');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0002','CMP020C106');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0003','PHY020C101');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0003','PHY020C102');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0003','PHY020C103');
INSERT INTO Programme_Modules VALUES('09UU0003','PHY020C106');
CREATE TABLE Students(
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(1,'Kevin Chalmers');
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(2,'Lisa Haskel');
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(3,'Arturo Araujo');
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(4,'Sobhan Tehrani');
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(100,'Oge Okonor');
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(200,'Kimia Aksir');
CREATE TABLE Student_Programme(
id INT,
programme VARCHAR(8),
FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES Students(id),
FOREIGN KEY (programme) REFERENCES Programmes(id));
INSERT INTO Student_Programme VALUES(1,'09UU0002');
INSERT INTO Student_Programme VALUES(2,'09UU0001');
INSERT INTO Student_Programme VALUES(3,'09UU0003');
INSERT INTO Student_Programme VALUES(4,'09UU0001');
```

You should now see tables listed in test_database, populated with values

Finally, you are ready to build some database-driven web pages!!


### Beginning a database-driven app for students, programmes and modules

You will now work through the following tasks.  The first set are worked through for you in the provided video. 

#### Worked tasks

1. Provide JSON output listing all students
2. Provide an HTML formatted output listing all students in a table where each student is linked to a single-student page
3. Create a single-student page which lists a student name, their programme and their modules

See the screencast for the worked example:
[Worked tasks screencast](https://roehampton.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d52ae6e3-d16f-43d8-83bc-add100d52764)

#### Independent tasks

1. Provide a JSON output of all programmes
2. Provide a HTML formatted output of all programmes in a table, where each programme is linked to a single-programme page
3. Create a single-programme page showing the programme title and listing all modules for the programme
4. Provide a JSON output of all modules
5. Provide a HTML formatted output of all modules in a table, where each module is linked to a single-module page
6. Provide a single-module page showing a module title, its programme and all the students for that module.


### Considering best practices

The worked example here is messy but it is useful as it provides a simple solution that introduces the most important principles all in one place, but this is not professional standard code.

Next week we will 'refactor' this code to provide a cleaner solution.  Can you think of ways we can use the following to improve our code:

 * Custom classes
 * Async functions and the await keyword
 * Separation of presentation and functionality (hint: we will use the Pug templating system to do this)
  * Adherence to accepted coding standards
